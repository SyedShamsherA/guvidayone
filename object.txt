                                       OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT

What is object in javascript?
Objects are important data type in javascript, objects are different than primitive data types(i.e., number, string, boolean etc)
Primitive data types contains one value but Objects can hold many values in form of key: value pairs. These keys can be variables or
functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some values. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

const data = {
    name:Syed Shamsher Ali;
    age:26;
    address:114/19, Gazi Nagar, Jabalpur, (Madhya Pradesh);
}

const newData = data.name/ data.age/ data.address;
console.log(newData) 
this newData will print 
data.name = Syed Shamsher Ali;
data.age = 26;
data.address = 114/19, Gazi Nagar, Jabalpur, (Madhya Pradesh);

The syntax for adding a property to an object is -
  ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

The syntax for deleting a property from an object is - 
  delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

The syntac for accessing a property from an object is -
  objectName.property        
           or
  objectName["property”]     
           or
  objectName[expression]  

OBJECT METHODS - An object method is an objectb property containing a function definition.
example - fucntion(){return ignition.on}

CREATE JAVASCRIPT OBJECT WITH OBJECT LITERAL
it's the easiest method to define property and it's value.
example - let bike = {
     name:'SuperSport';
     manufacturer: 'Ducati';
     engine: '937cc';
}

CREATE OBJECT WITH CONSTRUCTOR
example - function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe

USING JAVASCRIPT KEYWORD NEW 
example - var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “Shamsher”;
person.lastName = “Ali”;
person.age = 26;
person.eyeColor = “brown”;

USING OBJECT.CREATE METHODS
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method.
example - var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties
  displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal
    console.log(this.type);
  }
};
// Create new animal type called animal1 
var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates
// Create new animal type called Fishes
var fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = 'Fishes';
fish.displayType(); 
// Output:Fishes
